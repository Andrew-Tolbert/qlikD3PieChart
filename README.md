# qlikD3PieChart
d3 Pie Chart Extension for Qlik Sense

This D3 Extension allows for the creation of a **donut chart** with the following features. 
1. Selectable Color Palletes 
2. Donut Size and Inner Radius 
3. Label Font Size and Color 
4. Outline Size and Color 
5. Automatic Text wrapping that will kick in when a word break would cause a line to be longer than the space available, where space available is the space between the extension border and the outer diameter (this is dynamic and changes based on the point on the arc)
